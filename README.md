# Overview
Ferox is a ray-tracing renderer written in Rust. 

Currently, it is capable of detecting ray intersections with simple spheres and displaying those calculations in PNG form.

This project is made possible with the help of assets like scratchapixel.com and ssloy's tiny ray tracer (https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraytracer).
